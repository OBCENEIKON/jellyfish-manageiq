## How to create ManageIQ Automation Scripts
Jellyfish is utilizing the Service Catalog and Automation capabilities provided by ManageIQ to automate the provisioning of additional cloud services. This guide will walk you through the steps of creating catalog items and automation scripts, and then retrieving the information necessary about a catalog item to interact with jellyfish-core.

####Download and Install ManageIQ
Follow the steps provided here: http://manageiq.org/download/

###Creating an Automation Script
The following steps will guide you through the process of creating an automation method, adding it to a Service Provisioning Template, and then adding them to a Catalog Item. These steps allow them to interact with Jellyfish-UX and Jellyfish-Core. The automation scripts provided are located in in jellyfish-core/app/view/automate.

####Automation Basics
Here are some general basics to understand the automation scripts provided through jellyfish-core.

**Global Variables**

The global variable used through ManageIQ to access the options passed through the REST call is:

````
$evm
````
These scripts mainly use the root property and log method of this variable. To access the information passed from the call, use
````
$evm.root['dialog_variable_name]
````
To access the logger, use
````
$evm.root('level', 'message')
````
ManageIQ appends a 'dialog_' to every value passed through the payload that isn't one of their required and standard fields.

To run the provided scripts, you need the aws (http://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/) and rbvmomi (https://github.com/rlane/rbvmomi) ruby gems to be installed on your ManageIQ server.

###Using the ManageIQ API to retrieve Catalog Item properties
You will need properties Catalog Item properties to configure the use of jellyfish-core and ManageIQ through the UX. These properties that you need can be retrieved using the ManageIQ API as outlined below. The full ManageIQ REST API is available here: http://manageiq.org/documentation/development/rest_api/reference/

####Finding Available Catalog Service Items
To retrieve a list of all available service items, make a request to
````
GET /api/service_templates/
````

````
GET /api/service_templates/[catalog_id]
````
The **catalog_id** is what is needed to configure products. This value is the ManageIQ Type ID field on the Edit Products page.

####Retirement
For the automation methods currently provided in jellyfish-core, each one requires a separate Catalog Item with the appropriate retirement method included.
